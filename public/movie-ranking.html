<h1>The Best Movies According to Ben</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Brilliant film, I think this is may be Brad Pitts best film.  Need to really pay attention as during the film as they have inserted
still pictures that flash up for a second</p>
<h3>Super Mario Bros</h3>
<p>Really good animation film, took me back to the days when I would play mario on the SNES.</p>
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>This film again took me back to my childhood watching and playing with the toys.</p>
